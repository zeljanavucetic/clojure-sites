To initialize the database with the data you need to set :main to data.mongoDB in project.clj file. Then you run cmd and navigate to the project folder and type run lein. To start the web application you will need to change :main to start in project.clj file. Now, type in your browser http://localhost:9000/ and start to use this web app.
